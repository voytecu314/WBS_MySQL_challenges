SQL CHALLENGES 4

*******************************************************************************
*******************************************************************************

In the exercises below you will need to use the following clauses:
	- LIKE (%, _)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In SQL we can have many databases, they will show up in the schemas list
We must first define which database we will be working with. */

USE publications;

/*******************************************************************************
LIKE

Here we will also learn to use some wild card characters:

(You can ignore 'Wildcard Characters in MS Access'
You need to look at the section 'Wildcard Characters in SQL Server')
*******************************************************************************/

/* 1. Select all books from the table title that contain the word "cooking"
   in its title */

Select  title FROM titles WHERE title LIKE '%cooking%';

-- 2. Select all titles that start with the word "The"

Select  title FROM titles WHERE title LIKE 'The%';

/* 3. Select the full names (first and last name) of authors whose last name
   starts with "S" */

SELECT au_fname as name, au_lname as surname FROM authors WHERE au_lname LIKE 'S%';

/* 4. Select the name and address of all stores located in an Avenue
   (its address ends with "Ave.") */

SELECT stor_name, stor_address FROM stores WHERE stor_address LIKe '%A ve.';

/* 5. Select the name and address of all stores located in an Avenue or in a
   Street (address ended in "St.") */

SELECT stor_name, stor_address FROM stores WHERE stor_address LIKe '%A ve.' OR stor_address LIKe '% St.';


/* 6. Look at the "employee" table (select all columns to explore the raw data):
   Find a pattern that reveals whether an employee is Female or Male.
   Select all female employees. */

SELECT * FROM employee WHERE emp_id LIKE '%F';

/* 7. Select the first and last names of all male employees whose name starts
   with "P". */

SELECT fname, lname FROM employee WHERE emp_id LIKE '%M' AND fname LIKE 'P%';

/* 8. Select all books that have an "ing" in the title, with at least 4 other
   characters preceding it. For example, 'cooking' has 4 characters before the
   'ing', so this should be included; 'sewing' has only 3 characters before the
   'ing', so this shouldn't be included. */

SELECT * FROM titles WHERE title LIKE '%____ing%';

/*


In the exercises below you will need to use the following clauses:
    - IN (NOT IN)
    - BETWEEN (AND)

*/


/*******************************************************************************
IN

https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_in.asp
*******************************************************************************/

/* 9. Select the name and state of all stores located in either California (CA)
   or Oregon (OR) */

SELECT stor_name, state FROM stores WHERE state IN ('CA','OR');

/* 10. Using "IN", select all titles of type "psychology", "mod_cook" and
"trad_cook" */

SELECT * FROM titles WHERE `type` IN ("psychology","mod_cook","trad_cook");

/* 11. Select all the authors from the author table that do not come from the
cities Salt Lake City, Ann Arbor, and Oakland. */

SELECT * FROM authors WHERE city NOT IN (' Salt Lake City', 'Ann Arbor', 'Oakland');

/* The differences between =, LIKE and IN

= :   takes a single value to look for and matches only the exact value.

LIKE: takes a single to look for and allows wildcards (%, _) to match patterns
      in different positions.

IN :  takes many values to look for, such as a list of values, but does not
      work with the wildcards (%, _). */


/*******************************************************************************
BETWEEN

*******************************************************************************/

/* 12. Select all the order numbers with a quantity sold between 25 and 45 from
   the table sales */

SELECT ord_num FROM sales WHERE qty BETWEEN 25 AND 45;

-- 13. Select all the orders between 1993-03-11 and 1994-09-13

SELECT * FROM sales WHERE ord_date BETWEEN '1993-03-11' AND '1994-09-13';

/* 14. Select all job descriptions with a maximum level ("max_lvl") between 150
     and 200. */
SELECT job_desc FROM jobs WHERE max_lvl BETWEEN 150 AND 200;
