/* 6. Explore the table roysched and try to grasp the meaning of each column. 
   The notes below will help:
   
   - "Royalty" means the percentage of the sale price paid to the author(s).
   
   - Sometimes, the royalty may be smaller for the first few sales (which have
     to cover the publishing costs to the publisher) but higher for the sales 
     above a certain threshold.
     
   - In the "roysched" table each title_id can appear multiple times, with
     different royalty values for each range of sales.
     
   - Select all rows for particular title_id, for example "BU1111", and explore
	 the data. */



/* 7. Select all the book titles and the maximum royalty they can reach.
    Display only titles that are present in the roysched table. */
