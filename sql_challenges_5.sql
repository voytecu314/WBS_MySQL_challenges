In the exercises below you will need to use the following clauses:
    - GROUP BY
    - HAVING

/*******************************************************************************
GROUP BY

*******************************************************************************/

-- 1. Find the total amount of authors for each state

SELECT state, count(*) FROM authors GROUP BY state;

/* 2. Find the total amount of authors by each state and order them in 
    descending order */

SELECT state, count(*) FROM authors GROUP BY state ORDER BY count(*) desc;
SELECT state, count(*) as amount FROM authors GROUP BY state ORDER BY amount desc;
SELECT state, count(*) as amount FROM authors GROUP BY state ORDER BY state desc;

-- 3. What's the price of the most expensive title from each publisher?

SELECT pub_id, MAX(price) FROM titles GROUP BY pub_id;

-- 4. Find out the top 3 stores with the most sales

SELECT stor_id, SUM(qty) as sold FROM sales GROUP BY stor_id ORDER BY sold desc LIMIT 3;

/* 5. Find the average job level for each job_id from the employees table.
    Order the jobs in ascending order by its average job level. */

SELECT job_id, AVG(job_lvl) FROM employee GROUP BY job_id ORDER BY AVG(job_lvl);

/* 6. For each type (business, psychologyâ€¦), find out how many books each
    publisher has. */

SELECT pub_id, count(type) FROM titles GROUP BY pub_id;

/* 7. Add the average price of each publisher - book type combination from your
   previous query */
SELECT pub_id, count(type), ROUND(avg(price),2) FROM titles GROUP BY pub_id;

/*******************************************************************************
HAVING

https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_having.asp
*******************************************************************************/

/* 8. From your previous query, keep only the combinations of publisher - book
   type with an average price higher than 12 */
   
SELECT pub_id, count(type), ROUND(avg(price),2) as avg_price FROM titles GROUP BY pub_id HAVING avg_price > 12;


/* 9. Order the results of your previous query by these two criteria:
      1. Count of books, descendingly
      2. Average price, descendingly */
      
SELECT 
    pub_id, COUNT(`type`) AS books, ROUND(AVG(price), 2) AS avg_price
FROM
    titles
GROUP BY pub_id
HAVING avg_price > 12 ORDER BY books desc;

SELECT 
    pub_id, COUNT(`type`) AS books, ROUND(AVG(price), 2) AS avg_price
FROM
    titles
GROUP BY pub_id
HAVING avg_price > 12 ORDER BY avg_price desc;

/* 10. Some authors have a contract, while others don't - it's indicated in the
     "contract" column of the authors table.
     
     Select all the states and cities where there are 2 or more contracts 
     overall */

SELECT 
    state, COUNT(contract) AS have_contracts
FROM
    authors
WHERE
    contract > 0
GROUP BY state
HAVING have_contracts >= 2;

/* 
The main difference between WHERE and HAVING is that:
    - the WHERE clause is used to specify a condition for filtering most records
    - the HAVING clause is used to specify a condition for filtering values from 
      an aggregate (such as MAX(), AVG(), COUNT() etc...)
